# Application improvement stages

Collection of ML-enabled applications 
that consecutively improve upon each other
with a more elaborated and production-grade
architecture:

* jupyter notebook: model training
* monolith app (Python) with CLI; runs inference once
* monolith app processing user command line input sequentially
* first step to modularity: analytical REST service and CLI client
